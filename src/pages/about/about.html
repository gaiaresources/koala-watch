        <h2>Report Sick or Injured Koalas</h2>
        <p>
          Sick and injured koalas should also be reported directly to your <a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/native-animals/sick-or-injured-animals">local licensed wildlife rehabilitation group</a> for immediate action.
        </p>

        <h2>About I Spy Koala</h2>
        <p>
          I Spy Koala App was developed in 2019 by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) for the collection of koala observation and survey data.
          <br>
          This App is part of a pilot designed to improve the flow of Koala observation data to NSW planning and decisions tools.
          All data submitted via the App is made available by DPIE though BioNet, NSW’s corporate biodiversity data repository.
          From there data is accessible to researchers, land managers, planners, consultants, government and the public via the BioNet website <a href="http://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au/">www.bionet.nsw.gov.au</a> and associated data services.
          Once your I Spy Koala data is submitted it will be available in BioNet within one week.
          Your data will then be combined with other BioNet Koala observations and published to the SEED data portal where you can conveniently view the interactive <a href="https://geo.seed.nsw.gov.au/Public_Viewer/index.html?viewer=Public_Viewer&locale=en-AU&runWorkflow=AppendLayerCatalog&CatalogLayer=SEED_Catalog.192.Koala%20Species%20Sightings">Bionet Koala Sightings</a> map.
          Koala data helps inform environmental managers, land managers and the community about koala numbers, distribution and habitat, and assists the implementation of long term conservation strategies to secure healthy koala populations in the wild.
