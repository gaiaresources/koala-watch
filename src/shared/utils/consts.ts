`<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last modified on 21 January 2019</p>
<p>This is the privacy policy ('Privacy Policy') of the Office of Environment and Heritage’s
BioNet website located at www.bionet.nsw.gov.au (the Website), and Biosys, BioNet-Atlas,
  BioNet Vegetation Classification, BioNet APIs and I-Spy-Koala applications (collectively the
'App'). This Privacy Policy describes how OEH ('BioNet', 'Biosys', 'I Spy Koala', 'We', 'Us', 'Our') handles personal information (as defined below) that users provide to Us, or that We collect from You though the use of Our Websites or Apps.</p>

<h2>Web site and App Visitors</h2>
<p>The OEH collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OEH’s purpose in collecting
non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OEH visitors use its Website
and Apps. From time to time, OEH may release non-personally-identifying information in the
aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website and Apps.</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>'Personal Information' means information such as Your first / middle initial or name,
last name, e-mail address, street address, mailing address if different, town or city, state,
postal code, telephone number, date of birth, location data, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses,
personal photo, and any other information that would allow someone to identify You or contact
You.</p>

<p>OEH does not disclose such information other than as specified below.</p>

<h2>The Personal Information We Collect</h2>
<p>OEH may collect Personal Information when You choose to interact with the App in ways
that require OEH to gather such information, such as if You browse on www.bionet.nsw.gov.au,
register as an App User, update or add information in the App, provide content to BioNet through
Your computer or phone, or otherwise communicate with Us about the OEH service. When You post an
Observation on the App, We may collect Your User ID, latitude and longitude of the site of the
Observation, the place name of the site of the Observation, the date and time of the Observation,
the app You used to contribute data, and the time zone of the site of the Observation. The amount
and type of information that OEH gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case,
OEH collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose
of Your interaction with OEH. OEH does not disclose personally-identifying information other than
as described below, and You can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that doing so may prevent You from engaging in certain Website and App-related
activities.</p>

<h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
<p>We may use the Personal Information that You provide in order to provide the OEH services
and to administer and maintain the Website. If You register as an OEH User, You must give Us
current, complete, and accurate information and keep the information You provide to Us up to
date. We cannot and shall not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if
You do not give Us current, accurate, truthful or complete information or You fail to update
the information You give Us.</p>

<h2>How We Disclose and Share Personal Information</h2>
<p>Personal Information related to the Observations You post (User ID, date, time, location) 
is published on BioNet as matter of normal usage and therefore is shared with other BioNet Users. 
We explicitly share this public information in a machine-readable format for certain Observations 
with a handful of partners, including the Atlas of Living Australia, the Australian Ecological 
Knowledge Observation System (AEKOS), the Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data (SEED), and 
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (“GBIF”).</p>

<p>Personal Information associated with Users’ registration and account (name, email 
address, etc.) is shared with OEH’s BioNet staff.  OEH discloses potentially 
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its programmers, 
contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to 
process it on OEH’s behalf or to provide services available at OEH’s Website and Apps, 
and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>

<p>We share IP addresses, User agents, and information relating to software stability
(e.g. information about software crashes) and behaviour (e.g. the sequence of screens visited) 
with several analytics services. These processors include Google Analytics, and New Relic.
We do not share Your User ID, Username, email address, or name with any of these services.</p>

<p>Other than to its employees and contractors, as described above, OEH discloses 
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when 
required to do so by law, when OEH believes it is necessary to do so in the interest of 
User safety, or when OEH believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to 
protect the property or rights of OEH, third parties, or the public at large. Unless authorized 
by You through Your opt-in, or as provided above, We will make Your Personal Information 
available to non-affiliated third parties only in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>If We are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court, or other entity 
(e.g. to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process);</li>
<li>If We believe Your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy, or any 
applicable Website and App(s) Terms of Service, or if You threaten the rights, property or 
safety of Us, Our Website, Our Apps, any other Users, or third party;</li>
<li>If, in Our sole discretion, We believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or 
resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect Our assets, to defend Our interests, 
or comply with Our legal and regulatory obligations; or</li>
<li>If there is a merger, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination 
involving OEH.</li>
</ul>

<p>If You are a registered User of OEH Website or Apps and have supplied Your email address, 
OEH may occasionally send You an email to tell You about new features, solicit Your feedback, or 
keep You up to date with the OEH Website and App.  If You send Us a request (for example via a 
support email or via one of Our feedback mechanisms), We reserve the right to publish it in 
order to help Us clarify or respond to Your request or to help Us support other Users. OEH takes 
all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, 
or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
  
<p>We do not share Your Personal Information with any parties for commercial purposes.</p>

<h2>How We Retain Personal Information</h2>
<p>We retain Your personal information associated with Your registration for so long as You 
remain a registered User of an OEH Website or App.  In addition, We may retain personal 
information from closed accounts to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, 
troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce Our Terms of Service and take other 
actions permitted or required by applicable national laws.</p>

<p>Some Personal Information associated with Observations (User_ID, time, date, location, etc.) 
may remain attached to Observations, even after You have closed Your account.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children or knowingly 
allow children to purchase goods or memberships through Our Website and Apps. Visitors 16 
years of age and younger must obtain a parent or guardian's permission before submitting any 
personal information to this or any other website or App. In the event that We learn that We 
have received any personal information from a visitor 12 years of age or younger, and We do 
not receive parental permission within a reasonable period of time of Our request for it, We will 
delete that information as quickly as possible. If You believe that We might have information from 
or about a child 12 years of age or younger, please contact Us at bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, 
and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. OEH may 
uses cookies to help OEH identify and track visitors, their usage of the OEH Website, and their 
Website access preferences. OEH visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their 
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OEH websites, with the 
drawback that certain features of OEH websites may not function properly without the aid of 
cookies.</p>
  
<h2>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting the Personal Information You share with Us through use of 
OEH website and Apps, and We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards 
to protect Your Personal Information. We limit access to OEH Websites and Apps by Our own 
employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any 
employee found violating Our standards of security and confidentiality is subject to Our 
disciplinary processes. We request Our service providers to follow the same policy. 
Unfortunately, We cannot guarantee that data transmitted over the Internet will always be 
secure. As a result, although We strive to protect Your Personal Information, We cannot ensure 
or warrant the security of any information You transmit or We may learn as a result of Your use 
of OEH Website and App and You do so at Your own risk. If, for any reason, You do not agree 
with this Privacy Policy, please do not use or attempt to take advantage of any of the 
information, services, features, or functions of OEH Website and Appthat might require You to 
provide Your Personal Information.</p>

<h2>Your Rights with Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You have the right to know what Personal Information We have about You, request a copy of it, 
update and correct Your Personal Information, request that We stop collecting Your Personal 
Information, request a transfer of Your Personal Information, or ask questions about any 
automated decision-making processes regarding Your Personal Information. For any such 
information or requests, contact Our Data Protection Officer at bionet@environment.nsw.gov.au</p>

<h2>Posting Observations</h2>
<p>If You do not wish to have the time, date, place, or other identifying information of 
an Observation included on OEH Websites and Apps, You should not post an Observation. Once 
You post an Observation, You may not be able to change or remove it. Upon Your request we 
will remove Your Observations.</p>

<h2>Withdraw Consent</h2>
<P>If You withdraw Your consent for the use or disclosure of Your Personal Information 
for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy You may not have access to all Our Services 
and We might not be able to provide You all of the Services and customer support offered 
to Our Users and authorized under this Privacy Policy and Our Terms of Service Agreement.</P>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, iNaturalist.org may change its Privacy 
Policy from time to time, and in OEH sole discretion. We will post an updated and revised 
version of this Privacy Policy on the BioNet Website when any material changes have been made, 
and OEH encourages visitors to check this Privacy Policy often so You are aware of the most 
current terms and conditions that apply to You. The revisions are effective immediately upon 
posting. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will

<h2>Why are you collecting my personal information?</h2>
<p>The purpose of collecting your personal information is to help administer the App and help validate any observations submitted by you. OEH collects additional information for the Sensitive Species Data Licence because of the high-value information that this licence allows a person to access and enter into relevant App databases.</p>
We use your personal information to deliver our services to you so that you can participate in the full experience of the App.</p>

<p>Subject to the below, OEH will not disclose your personal information to any third party.</p>
<p>When you post an observation, this information is published on the App. </p>
<p>The information that will be published is your user name, your unique Bionet observer identification number, and information about the physical site where an observation was made, including place name, time, time zone, date and coordinates.  As noted above, your user name may include your personal information if you can be identified from this information.  However, your observer identity does not have to be your name and we publish the observer identity to project the integrity of the observation process. </p>
<p>In addition to being published, this information will be disclosed to other parties. As these projects are part of broader national studies and conservation works we share your observations in a machine-readable format for certain observations with the Atlas of Living Australia, the Australian Ecological Knowledge Observation System (AEKOS), the Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data (SEED), and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</p>
